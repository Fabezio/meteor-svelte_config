# hello friends!
### this is a script for an easy meteor setup including svelte.
Its filename is *newapp.sh*.  
Before, there are things to handle:
- it was written for ***linux/BSD/MAC*** (! a mere bash file ;) )
- the default path is your home one followed by '''Appdev_web/meteor-svelte'''. you may easily change this inside the path name (named $mypath);
- bootstrap is the default css framework, once more you comment or delete it two ways:
    - inside file (if you wanna change automation),
    - or inside client/main.html file.

Here are the steps to install it:
1. open a terminal and 'cd' to you meteor folder.
2. clone or download the repo content into your chosen folder.
3. enter *./newapp.sh* followed by your project name.
Of course you may modify it for wour own usage.
