# Hello friends :grinning:
## This is a script for an easy meteor setup including svelte.

Its filename is *newapp.sh*.  
Before, there are a few things to handle:

    - it was written for ***linux/BSD/MAC*** (! a mere bash file :wink:)
    - the default path is your home one followed by *Appdev_web/meteor-svelte*. You may easily change this inside the path name (named $mypath);
    - bootstrap is the default css framework, once more you comment or delete it two ways:
        - inside file (if you wanna change automation),
        - or inside client/main.html file.

## Setup steps

Here are the steps to install it:

  1. open a terminal and 'cd' to you meteor folder.
  2. clone or download the repo content into your chosen folder.
  3. enter ```./newapp.sh``` followed by your project name.  


Of course you may modify it for your own usage.  
One more thing: default editor is **Visual Studio Code**. If you use another one, just replace **code** whith your own editor name in *newapp.sh* (for example ```atom``` for *atom* - ```subl``` if it is *sublime-text*).
That's all. Enjoy!
